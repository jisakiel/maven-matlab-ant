This is a sample maven module using ant for invoking a custom matlab compiler task as part of a maven build. 

The custom task is MccTask (and compiled by maven before the ant target is invoked), with an example setup in build.xml . It is only run if the run_EXECNAME.sh script is older than the main file and includes.

It will only work on linux and mac. No provision is made for including multiple architectures as attachments, but it should be easy to modify.
